; This is an emacs-based interface to the notmuch mail system.
;
; You will first need to have the notmuch program installed and have a
; notmuch database built in order to use this. See
; http://notmuchmail.org for details.
;
; To install this software, copy it to a directory that is on the
; `load-path' variable within emacs (a good candidate is
; /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp). If you are viewing this from the
; notmuch source distribution then you can simply run:
;
;	sudo make install-emacs
;
; to install it.
;
; Then, to actually run it, add:
;
;	(require 'notmuch)
;
; to your ~/.emacs file, and then run "M-x notmuch" from within emacs,
; or run:
;
;	emacs -f notmuch
;
; Have fun, and let us know if you have any comment, questions, or

  "Major mode for viewing a thread with notmuch.

This buffer contains the results of the \"notmuch show\" command
for displaying a single thread of email from your email archives.

By default, various components of email messages, (citations,
signatures, already-read messages), are hidden. You can make
these parts visible by clicking with the mouse button or by
pressing RET after positioning the cursor on a hidden part, (for
which \\[notmuch-show-next-button] and \\[notmuch-show-previous-button] are helpful).

Reading the thread sequentially is well-supported by pressing
\\[notmuch-show-advance-marking-read-and-archiving]. This will scroll the current message (if necessary),
advance to the next message, or advance to the next thread (if
already on the last message of a thread). As each message is
scrolled away its \"unread\" tag will be removed, and as each
thread is scrolled away the \"inbox\" tag will be removed from
each message in the thread.

Other commands are available to read or manipulate the thread more
selectively, (such as '\\[notmuch-show-next-message]' and '\\[notmuch-show-previous-message]' to advance to messages without
removing any tags, and '\\[notmuch-show-archive-thread]' to archive an entire thread without
scrolling through with \\[notmuch-show-advance-marking-read-and-archiving]).

You can add or remove arbitary tags from the current message with
'\\[notmuch-show-add-tag]' or '\\[notmuch-show-remove-tag]'.

threads in the current buffer.

Other useful commands are '\\[notmuch-search-filter]' for filtering the current search
based on an additional query string, '\\[notmuch-search-filter-by-tag]' for filtering to include

This buffer contains a list of message counts returned by a
customizable set of searches of your email archives. Each line in
the buffer shows the name of a saved search and the resulting
message count.

Pressing RET on any line opens a search window containing the
results for the saved search on that line.

Here is an example of how the search list could be
customized, (the following text would be placed in your ~/.emacs
file):

(setq notmuch-folders '((\"inbox\" . \"tag:inbox\")
